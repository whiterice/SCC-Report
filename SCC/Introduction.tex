\subsection{Introduction to Project}
\label{af:intro:proj}

\noindent The Power System Short Circuit Current Calculations for \Customer{} was prepared by PowerCore Engineering.\\

\noindent \emph{The Short Circuit Study} determined the maximum fault current all protective devices, transformers, and cables within the scope of this study would be
subjected to in the event of a bolted three-phase fault.\\


\subsection{Scope}
\label{af:intro:scope}

Our study included the following equipment:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Main Incoming power supply and Associated Equipment.
	\item All 3 Phase Electrical Equipment, excluding the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Equipment supplied by circuit protection rated for less than 60A. 
		\item Equipment below 208V supplied by a transformer rated for less than 125 kVA in its immediate supply.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
